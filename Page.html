        <h1>AIML</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two of the most significant advancements in the field of computer science and technology. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on tasks through experience.</p>
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies, including natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. The goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.</p>
        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning is a branch of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
        <h3>Applications of AIML</h3>
        <p>The applications of AIML are vast and varied. Some common applications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image and speech recognition</li>
            <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
            <li>Financial forecasting</li>
            <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
            <li>Personalized recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the field continues to evolve, the potential for AI and ML to transform industries and improve lives is immense.</p>
